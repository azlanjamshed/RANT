    title: "How I Built My First Website",
    details:
      "I started web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Initially, I faced many challenges understanding layouts and responsiveness. After learning React, things became easier. I built my first personal portfolio website, added animations, routing, and later deployed it using Vercel. The whole journey taught me the importance of practicing real-world projects.",

    title: "Tips for Responsive Design",
    details:
      "Responsive design is crucial in today's mobile-first world. I began by learning how to use media queries effectively. Then I explored frameworks like Tailwind CSS, which made responsiveness much easier. Using utilities like `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:` helped me tailor layouts to all screen sizes. I also learned about mobile UX and how to optimize performance for slower networks.",

    title: "Mastering JavaScript Functions",
    details:
      "Understanding functions in JavaScript changed the way I code. From basic functions to arrow functions, callbacks, and closures — everything adds a new layer of power. I started using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` regularly. I also built my own utilities and used them across projects, which helped me write cleaner, reusable code.",

    title: "Why I Switched from Bootstrap to Tailwind",
    details:
      "I was initially a big fan of Bootstrap due to its grid system and ready-made components. But once I discovered Tailwind CSS, I found it far more flexible. I could style components quickly without leaving my HTML. The utility-first approach reduced my CSS file size and allowed me to maintain better consistency across my UI. Now I use Tailwind for every new project.",

    title: "My Experience with React Hooks",
    details:
      "React Hooks completely changed how I write React components. I used to rely on class components for managing state and lifecycle, but now `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` handle everything much more cleanly. I recently built a todo app where I used custom hooks to separate logic, making the code more readable and testable.",

    title: "Learning Full-Stack in 3 Months",
    details:
      "Becoming a full-stack developer seemed intimidating at first. I started with frontend skills (React, Tailwind) and then moved to backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB). Building a complete MERN app gave me confidence. I learned about APIs, authentication, deployment on Render, and using Git for version control. It’s intense but totally doable with consistency!",
